The integration tests use certificates obtained from a variety of public sources, in addition to certifictes that
were created specifically for testing purposes. Notably, some of the certificates obtained from public sources
have been modified to trigger specific test conditions. The flagging of error conditions, etc. for a given certificate
does not necessarily mean that the given certificate is mis-issued.
